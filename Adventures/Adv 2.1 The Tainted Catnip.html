        The adventure begins with a scream from several rooms down the hall from

            It is also evident this this catnip, before being cut would offer

          The market area has been covered with a giant tent which spans the
          entire market place. A multicoloured magic fabric sparkles and lights
          the inside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Looking up from the inside, the entire top of the tent is bewitched
          with a variety of magical effects and lights. It looks like the night
          sky with dancing lights, sparkles and magical fireworks cascading
          through the air.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inside the regular market stalls can be found, along with some new and

          The cradle are one of the older guilds in the region and a cat
          focussed guild.
        </li>
        <li>
          The head of the cradle will explain that someone has broken into the
          store of one of their members, Master Pettifer’s Emporium and that
          they have attempted to frame the cradle for their wrong doing.
        </li>
        <li>
          He will offer a pretty sizeable reward of 200gp each for the
          completion of the task.
        </li>
        <li>
          They will disappear into the shadows and will offer Juseff’s help if
          the party want it. Although he really doesnt have much to offer in
          that regard.
        </li>
      </dl>

      <h2 class="header">Master Pettifer’s Emporium</h2>
      <dl>
        <li>
          Upon arriving at the ship they will find that there is a variety of
          broken glass inside and the place is a bit of a mess. Inside will be
          Master Pettifer & Rufus attempting to clean the mess. The shop is
          always somewhat of a mess, but this is something else.
        </li>
        <li>
          Three of his items, and a small pouch of gold 30gp will have been
          stolen.
        </li>
        <li>
          A search within the shop will reveal a set of boot prints, as well as
          some string on the jagged glass.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whilst both will be keen to help find the missing items, neither of
          them will be particularly happy about speaking to the new arrivals.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Watch House have been informed of the break in, however they are
          renoun for not being that good with ‘gang crimes’. They are too
          focused on other issues.
        </li>
      </dl>

      <h2 class="header">The Masters Retreat</h2>
      <dl>
        <li>
          Arriving at Seilf Emit will reveal a pretty run down place, with a
          strong dislike for any animal that is awoken. Patrons will tut and
          spit at any animal who gets too close to them.
        </li>
        <li>The barman will be less than forthcoming with any information.</li>
        <li>
          With an investigation check (DC14), players can find a trapdoor to the
          cellar hidden underneath a table in the room off to the side. It would
          require stealth to enter without detection.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is also a beer garden where Swindell & Buller can be found,
          discussing with 3 goblins about the plans for the Cunning Man.
        </li>
      </dl>

      <h2 class="header">The Cellar</h2>
      <dl>
        <li>
          Upon entering the cellar players will note that it is a relatively
          simple hole underneath the tavern.
        </li>
        <li>
          Downstairs they will find a few empty crates in a variety of sizes.
          They will have traces of animal hair inside with the a high
          investigation check.
        </li>
        <li>
          There will also be shreds of paper around the floor. They have a
          variety of nail marks through them suggested they have been pinned and
          removed multiple times. The pages also show multiple names. A nature
          check will reveal these are actually breeds and species of animal and
          these were the name tags on the cages.
        </li>
      </dl>

      <h2 class="header">The Garden</h2>
      <dl>
        <li>
          The garden is quite simple, little more than a few picnic benches
          surrounded by a tall, 7ft high wall.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sitting at one bench, two humans can be found, Swindel & Buller. Close
          by on a second table can be found 3x Goblins who are just sitting
          listening to them discuss.
        </li>
        <li>
          If they detect anyone, roll for initiative and a fight will break out.
          Both Swindel & Buller will attempt to surrender, if they are given the
          chance to, depending how blood thirsty the party are.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once defeated the inn will erupt into chaos. Now that Swindel & Buller
          are dead, it would seem the patrons no longer care about the place and
          are robbing it blind.
        </li>
        <li>
          On the bodies the following can be found:
          <dd><input type="checkbox" />Money Pouch (30gp)</dd>
          <dd><input type="checkbox" />Money Pouch (20gp)</dd>
          <dd><input type="checkbox" />Receipt ‘Timorys Shipyard Wonders’</dd>
          <dd><input type="checkbox" />Badly Written Note, from CM.</dd>
        </li>
      </dl>

      <h2 class="header">Back Inside</h2>
      <dl>
        <li>
          The inn has emptied, leaving behind a pile of broken glass. It would
          appear more than just the ones thrown at Elvis. Clearly several fights
          took place, the tables are over turned.
        </li>
        <li>
          The cash register has been emptied and most of the strong alcohol has
          been taken. Word travels fast that Swindel and Buller have died. There
          are no patrons at all, and no one will arrive, its clear that the
          place is now ‘shut’.
        </li>
      </dl>

      <h2 class="header">Timorys Shipyard Wonders</h2>
      <dl>
        <li>
          Timorys Shipyard Wonders honestly looks like a junk yard. A look
          around the place will reveal a variety of half started and poorly
          finished projects.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is also clear to see that Timory clearly keeps things close to his
          chest and a variety of the projects have got large sheets to cover
          them away from prying eyes.
        </li>
        <li>
          The items stolen from Master Pettifers were deemed useless and have
          been sold on to Timory, who will be more than willing to sell them
          back, for a fair profit in his mind. The current asking price is
          double their original sold value on the receipt.
          <dd><input type="checkbox" />Handsized Chest (10GP – 20GP)</dd>

      <dl>
        <li>
          Master Pettifer will be surprisingly grateful that they are party have
          returned. He will also comment on the speed at which they have
          achieved the result. Given his experience with The Watch, he will be
          very happy. Well, at least as happy as he gets…
        </li>
        <li>
          A reward of the following will be provided:
          <dd><input type="checkbox" />A small money pouch with 6gp.</dd>
          <dd>
            <input type="checkbox" /> If all 3 items a returned, he will offer
            them one free of charge. He will however offer no explanation as of
            what they do.

      <h2 class="header">The Cradle</h2>
      <dl>
        <li>
          Approaching the safehouse to claim your reward, a severe lack of
          movement will be noticed. Previously there were signs of life, but now
          there is nothing. The cradle themselves appear to have moved on from
          this safehouse for now, relocating to a new and undisclosed location.
        </li>
        <li>
          A hidden sign will be found painted on the wall, which will advise
          that the cradle will be found when they are needed. Until then
          however, thank you for your work.
        </li>
      </dl>

      <h2 class="header">The Scratch Post</h2>
      <dl>
        <li>
          The scratching post is full of patrons, and is surprisingly busy for
          the season and time of year. A few people are discussing an event
          tomorrow, although its not evidently clear what that is.
        </li>
        <li>
          There will be some additional pouches of money given to each person
          they will not find until the morning. There will also be an entire Ham
          Hock, as well as a tray of a new form of catnip placed on the table
          for the players enjoyment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Overnight there will be some crashing and banging from many streets
          away, it doesn’t sound harrowing but does wake you a couple of times.
          (doesn’t impact long rest)
