# A Friend In Need

## An Interesting Introduction

<em>
You walk through the streets following your brief time with the cult of Ouroborous, each of you is lost in thought, all different thoughts, but lost none the less. Its actually somewhat of a shock as one of you bumps into a very well dressed human. You stagger backwards and land on your arse on the floor.
</em>

Before you stands Volothamp Geddarm (Volo) a widley traveled sage and wizard. He is the realms "go-to-guy" even if his information is, at best, only half-accurate.

- He bows deeply, and greets the party with a 'Well met, friends, allow me to introduce myself, I am Volothamp Geddarm'.
- It is at this moment he notices the party member on the floor and apologies profusely before helping them to their feet. He then casts Prestidigitation to clean them. and flavours them subtley of mint.
- As an apology he insists they join him at The Silver Sovereign, his favourite of all the inns for a drink, his treat.

## At The Inn

- Volo leads you to a corner table where he attempt to try not to draw much attention to himself.
- The inn keeper, Zel (and secret member of the Xanathar Guild), sullenly washes dishes behind the bar, whilst a particularly rowdy and raucous crew of theiflings laughs, jokes and throws dice in the corner.

**Objectives/Goals.** Volo wants to hire the heroes to recover a stolen key (truthfully, it’s not stolen, Volo just wants it) engraved with a gold dragon that he claims allows entrance into Ahghairon’s Tower. Ahghairon’s Tower was formerly the home of the great wizard who was the first lord of the Moonshae Isles and has been sealed by magic for generations. Volo has rented rooms here for the heroes and asks them to go find the key and get it at any cost. He promises to include them in any exploration of Ahgharion’s Tower (“There’s wealth there beyond your wildest dreams, my dearest friend, but we need the key first!”). Truth be told, Zolo hasnt got a large amount of cash to give the adventurers at the moment. Zel wants to hear what the
heroes are doing so he can report it back to The Xanathar. The thieflings want to be left alone.

**What Do They Know?** Volo knows that the key was last seen in the new Seilf Emit The Pawn Shop. He urges the heroes to recover the key—giving them specific instructions on how to find the pawn shop, as well as a picture of the key itself. Volo also knows that Ahghairon's Tower is a about half a days walk north of the city. He knows the way. Zel knows about Sielf Emit The Pawn Shop, and that people have been turning up dead and gruesomely murdered around Skull Square which makes the community nervous. The thieflings know that they normally hang out in Skull Square, but they haven’t been lately because of the murders. They only go as a large pack.

**Murders?** Adventurers may wonder why this is the first time they are hearing of these horrific murders, and its simple because the town guard have been trying to keep it under wraps. They dont want the town going into panic after only just getting back to normal after the violence from the seige. But like anything, you cant keep something like this under wraps for long, townsfolk talk, and rumours only grow.

### Note

If pressed for money up front, Volo will take great offence and leave. He had offered a chance

# Opertunity Lost

<em>

Volo stands up, and throws his drink in the face of one of the party (Dex Save). He looks visibly upset before saying. "Fine, it would seem all you care about is money, rather than helping those around you. And I dont have time for this"

With this he stands up from his seat, mutters a few words before giving a single, loud finger click. He then he disappears entirely. As he does so there is a very noticable rush air around you, it ruffles hair, and causes a few pages of paper to fly towards where he once stood. It is as if there was a small void where once he stood that suddently needed to be filled.

It would seem your overly keen desire for a 'reward' has cost you the opportunity of adventure on this occassion, and with it, any hope of visiting the hidden tower volo spoke of. Perhaps you may think more carefully next time on your approach.
