    Gullet Cove is many things. But most importantly, its a port. Ships are
    supplied and fitted out here for lengthy voyages; they also end their trips
    here, dropping off vast quantities of cargo which the Guilds and the
    hundreds of merchants and traders all quickly descend on, picking out the
    best bits and making ready to sell them on - at a tidy profit! The port is
    the towns most important and busiest place. It is constantly busy - even at
    night, sailors wander the streets (most of them having just been thrown out
    of one tavern and already looking for the next) and those merchants who are
    happy to make their money by illegal means as well as lawful do a little
    extra business on the side.

    The port consist of the docks, always crowded with ships both large and
    small, and the various warehouses in which goods are stored before they can
    be sold on. The streets near to the broad, open sweep of sea and the various
    mooring points are close and claustrophobic. The warehouses are large,
    looming buildings and, as Gullet Cove has become a richer and busier town,
    more have been built in a space scarcely able to accommodate them. At night,
    when the mist drifts in from the sea, and the few lanterns which hang from
    isolated way-posts or the signs of small, grim-looking taverns cast shadows,
    the docks can quickly become a dangerous and threatening place to be. It is
    perhaps this which has resulted in such sinister rumours gathering around
    the place - no respectable citizen visits the docks after the sun has begun
    to set. Strange creatures are said to venture up and into the streets during
    the night, prowling the secluded streets, or breaking into the warehouses to
    filch whatever they can. Who knows what truth there is in such wild claims?
    Certainly, it is difficult to believe the claims of skulking men with the
    visages of rats. Or of rats which move with the coordination and
    intelligence of humans. But the stories persist, nevertheless.

    Less outlandish are the stories of the secret meeting spots dotted around
    the docks, in which black market deals are struck and bargains are made.
    These are all kept concealed from the towns Watch, but are, it is said,
    tacitly approved of by the Council who recognise that a certain degree of
    illicit trade is, in fact, good for business. The late-night deals are
    conducted in carefully protected and carefully concealed trading houses.
    These are sometimes at the back of the various rough taverns which nestle in
    between warehouses, sometimes in the side-rooms of warehouses. Other times,
    the deals require even more clandestine locations: it is well known that the
    Thieves Guild and the Cradle possess secret hiding places throughout the
    town and, for the right price, those in the docks can be accessed. Of
    course, it isnt cheap and requires a long-term contract being signed with
    the Thieves Guild which is, or at least can be, somewhat dangerous for those
    who dont read the fine print. The Thieves Guild arent just good at picking
    pockets literally; they are also extensively skilled at tying the
    unsuspecting in legal knots and taking their money that way. For those
    merchants who can afford the exorbitant rates (or have lawyers as good as
    the Thieves Guilds), such meeting spots are the best place to conduct the
    shady business for which the docks are infamous.
