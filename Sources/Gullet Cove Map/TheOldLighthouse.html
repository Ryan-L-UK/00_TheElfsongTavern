  <h1>The Old Lighthouse</h1>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <br />
  <p>
    Pointing out into the bay, on a rugged spit of land known as Fang Point, the
    old lighthouse of Gullet Cove is a familiar feature to many sailors who make
    port their home. Its role is vital, the coast around Gullet Cove is
    treacherous and there are numerous patches of submerged rocks. In the past,
    ships were lured onto these rocks, deliberately wrecked, and then pillaged
    by the Gullet Cove smugglers and pirates. In these more civilised times,
    Fang Point guides ships into the harbour where they can be pillaged by
    legal, if no less ruthless, means. Fang Point Lighthouse is relatively new.
    It was built approximately fifty years ago, after the previous lighthouse
    collapsed.

  <p>
    It is a solid, well-kept tower with a large, magically powered lamp in its
    peak. The lamp itself is a marvel of dwarven engineering. Shaped into the
    likeness of four tiger heads, light blazes forth from their maws, teeth
    bared and roaring across the bay. It is one of the first things most
    visitors to Gullet Cove see, and one of the last things they forget.
  </p>
  <p>The Lighthouse is crewed by three keepers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A dwarf called Migran.</li>
    <li>A bobtail cat known as Ginger Mick</li>
    <li>
      A grizzled, white-haired veteran of a decade of hard sailing, Grion
      Whistle
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The lighthouse is reliable, which, as the sailors say, is all it damn well
    needs to be. All three of the keepers are experienced, committed, and
    usually to be found smoking a pipe (even Ginger Mick...especially Ginger
    Mick) or sipping from a flask (bowl) filled with rum. The three speak
    relatively little but they see every ship heading into Gullet Cove...always
    useful information for those willing to invest time into winning their
    confidence.
