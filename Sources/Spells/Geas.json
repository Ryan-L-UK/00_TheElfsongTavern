If the creature can understand you,  it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed by you,  it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions,  but no more than once each day. A creature that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.",
