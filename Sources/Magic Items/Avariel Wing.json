The wing itself is in perfect condition despite the fact it is organic and has clearly been removed for some time.","I1H-in":"","I1D-in":"The wing itself has no obvious use, the feathers could be used for a quill or even a cloak. If the wing were to be reunited with its owner it could be grafted back on and probably work perfectly, although without its twin, it would make for a decidedly one sided Avariel.","I2H-in":"","I2D-in":"","I3H-in":"","I3D-in":"","I4H-in":"","I4D-in":"","I5H-in":"","I5D-in":"","I6H-in":"","I6D-in":"","I7H-in":"","I7D-in":"","I8H-in":"","I8D-in":""}
