{"IName_input":"Staff of Flowers","IType_input":"Staff, weapon, common","WType_input":"Simple weapon, melee weapon","WDmg_input":"1d6 bludgeoning - versatile (1d8)","Desc1_input":"This wooden staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of you, or from the staff itself. Unless you choose a specific kind of flower, the staff creates a mild-scented daisy. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal flower would.","Desc2_input":"The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns into flower petals and is lost forever.","Desc3_input":"Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.","Source_input":"Xanathar's Guide to Everything, pg. 139"}
