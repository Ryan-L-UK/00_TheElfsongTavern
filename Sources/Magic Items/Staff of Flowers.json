While holding it,  you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of you,  or from the staff itself. Unless you choose a specific kind of flower,  the staff creates a mildscented daisy. The flower is harmless and nonmagical,  and it grows or withers as a normal flower would. The staff regains 1d6  + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge,  roll a d20. On a 1,  the staff turns into flower petals and is lost forever.","I1H-in":"","I1D-in":"","I2H-in":"","I2D-in":"","I3H-in":"","I3D-in":"","I4H-in":"","I4D-in":"","I5H-in":"","I5D-in":"","I6H-in":"","I6D-in":"","I7H-in":"","I7D-in":"","I8H-in":"","I8D-in":""}
