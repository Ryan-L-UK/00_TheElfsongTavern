While holding the hat, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and speak a command word that summons your choice of a bat, a frog, or a rat. The summoned creature magically appears in the hat and tries to get away from you as quickly as possible. The creature is neither friendly nor hostile, and it isnâ€™t under your control. It behaves as an ordinary creature of its kind and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 hit points. The hat regains all expended charges daily at dawn.","I1H-in":"","I1D-in":"","I2H-in":"","I2D-in":"","I3H-in":"","I3D-in":"","I4H-in":"","I4D-in":"","I5H-in":"","I5D-in":"","I6H-in":"","I6D-in":"","I7H-in":"","I7D-in":"","I8H-in":"","I8D-in":""}
