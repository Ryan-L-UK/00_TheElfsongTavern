The wing itself is in perfect condition despite the fact it is organic and has clearly been removed for some time.","Desc2_input":"The wing itself has no obvious use, the feathers could be used for a quill or even a cloak. If the wing were to be reunited with its owner it could be grafted back on and probably work perfectly, although without its twin, it would make for a decidedly one sided Avariel.","Desc3_input":"","Source_input":"Homebrew."}
