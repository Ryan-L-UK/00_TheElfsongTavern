It is said that when the stone is rubbed a cauldron full of gold appears in front of the user. ","Desc2_input":"This sadly is not the Gold Stone the legend speaks of, and is in fact the Glod stone. When this stone is rubbed, rather than a large cauldron of gold appearing, instead a large pot appears with a very angry looking gnome called Glod inside. ","Desc3_input":"Glod is a very real, very annoyed Gnome, who has been magically teleported against his will to the casterâ€™s location. He has no means to get home, aside walk. Every time the stone is rubbed, he will be magically teleported from his currently location, to this one, even across dimensions. This, as you can imagine is a cause of much frustration to him.
