{"DName_input":"Ptolemeow (2)","Desc1_input":"As you awaken in the Welcoming Dark you find yourself inside an unfamiliar room. You look around the room and see each wall is lined with a set of shelves with a mix of tools and arcane parts. In the centre of the room is a large work bench and a set of incredibly detailed schematics. You begin like most would by checking the plans and find quickly that these appear to be the plans for a small construct.","Desc2_input":"You start to search the shelves looking for the various parts needed on the schematics, an arm here, a small leg there, and some cogs and gears. It doesn’t take long before it would appear you are making some very real progress. Despite the initial chaos of the room layout, it would seem it is actually fairly well organized.","Desc3_input":"What feels like hours go by, but you continue working until at last you have a fully working homunculus arcane construct. Or at least it would be fully working if you could find a way to power it. You claw through your mind looking for anything that could be used as a power source. Suddenly you are reminded that some constructs can be powered by precious gemstones. With a pace some would almost consider frantic, you begin combing the shelves for any gemstones or jewels that could make a good power source of the construct. But alas, the shelves have everything you could need. The crankshaft for the arcane engine on a lightning storm breakers airship, no problem. But a small gemstone to power a construct appears too much to ask.","Desc4_input":"You pat down your pockets and that’s when you feel it, an unusual weight in a pocket normally empty. You put it out and find yourself holding a small purple gemstone. How did that get there you wonder? Before you can place it in your construct, you awaken and find yourself back in the room you left. But that weight in your pocket remains, what could it be?","Desc5_input":"","Desc6_input":"","Desc7_input":"","Desc8_input":""}
