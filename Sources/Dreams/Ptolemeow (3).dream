If that old friend were to visit you every single day, and fill your already cluttered mind with yet more information, but here you are once again. ","Desc2_input":"This time you find yourself inside what is some form of showroom, but strangely it seems this is a showroom for Artificers. Upon pedestals around the room sit a variety of eldritch machines each with a different purpose. You recognise a modified version of your eldritch cannon, as well as the flamethrower, but there would appear to be a few new ones around you don’t recognise.","Desc3_input":"Several catch your eye, but the one that is most of note is the ‘Throne Cannon’. Appearing to not only have a seat perfectly sized for you for targeting purposes, it appears it also has legs and can be used as a form of mechanised vehicle. The idea of never having to walk again, and having your own portable artillery does peak your interest. ","Desc4_input":"You open your money pouch to look for the gold needed to purchase it, and find yourself sucked into the void and falling through the blackness. You awaken back in the terrestrial plane, feeling somewhat jilted you hadn't been able to purchase the plans before you left. But it certainly did give you some ideas for some other eldritch cannons.  ","Desc5_input":"","Desc6_input":"","Desc7_input":"","Desc8_input":""}
