{"DName_input":"Elvis (1)","Desc1_input":"The Welcoming Dark is not a new place for you, and you are aware that at times it can be both cruel and kind. This particular plane at first glance appears to be one of your personal favorites. The familiar sound of tavern chatter can be heard, and the smell of freshly cooked meats and hams fills your nostrils. Your eyes open and a bright white light is pointed at you, obscuring the room. It only takes you a few seconds, as well as the rhythmic cheers of ‘Elvis’ to realize what you must do. You are on a stage and this is your crowning performance, you must not let down your beloved fans, after all, they have travelled far and wide to see you.","Desc2_input":"Your set begins and its one of your best yet, you begin singing songs of your adventures and whilst you can’t see them because of the light, you hear the crowd singing along with you.

He claps again and you notice, in a mistake only an amateur would make, your claw catches the high string and snaps it. The whip of the metal string raps across your knuckles and you call out in pain ruining the song.","Desc4_input":"The cheering of the crowd slowly changes to boos which echos around the room. With your guitar out of tune, a broken string and the laughs of Tom o’th’Alley, you close your eyes in the hope it will all go away, then suddenly, silence. When you open them, you find yourself back on the terrestrial plane once more, safe? That last part remains to be seen…","Desc5_input":"","Desc6_input":"","Desc7_input":"","Desc8_input":""}
