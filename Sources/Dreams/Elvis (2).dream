You have no doubt he will return, but at least for now, you are in the clear. Seated in your favorite restaurant, you find yourself sharing a small circular table with a cloaked cat.

But just as you gain control of your feelings, you see one of the dogs throw his empty glass at another cat. The room falls silent, and in your ear you hear a low whisper:\n","Quote4":"on","Desc4_input":"Do It","Desc5_input":"You fire your crossbow, striking the first dog right between the eyes. The second hits another in the chest killing him instantly. The third falls to his knees, and begs for mercy.
