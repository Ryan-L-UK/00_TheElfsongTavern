{"DName_input":"Cedar (3)","Desc1_input":"It has felt like an age since you have been back to the welcome dark, but in truth, it has only been a single night in this plane. Your new found connection with nature, your new feeling of faith are something that you wonder if the welcoming dark will adapt too. Your last two visits were plagued by visions of things that may come to pass, but this time you feel a little more relaxed.","Desc2_input":"You begin to walk down a cobblestone road, you dont know where the road will take you, but you hope it will lead you to somewhere new. You walk past trees, plants, bushes and open fields of wheat and barley. The sky is blue, and the sun warm and inviting. Along the road you find a single inn standing at a fork in the road. As you get closer you notice that it is the scratching post, but its in the middle of nowhere, far from anything. This being a dream, you dont question it at first.","Desc3_input":"Walking forward you arrive at the fork to see a signpost marking each route, to the left you see the sign reads 'druid', to the right reads 'cleric' It would appear your time in the welcoming dark expects you to walk a path, but the question is which? A little conflicted you walk towards the scratching post, and sit upon the step by the front door looking back over the path you took to get here.","Desc4_input":"You hear a familiar voice coming from inside the inn, calling you. You stand and turn to walk through the door, and arrive back in the terrestrial plane.","Desc5_input":"","Desc6_input":"","Desc7_input":"","Desc8_input":""}
