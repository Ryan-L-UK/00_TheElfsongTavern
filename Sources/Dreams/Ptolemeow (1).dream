{"DName_input":"Ptolemeow (1)","Desc1_input":"Here we go again, quiet, peace, a moment to let your mind run free. The Welcoming Dark gives your mind a blank canvas with which to run wild. The gods have elected to leave you be, this time. As such you find yourself in a simple room, a giant chalkboard lines the largest wall and a stash of fresh chalk sits beside it. You begin with what starts as a simple doodle, but quickly transitions into notes, designs and complex calculations. Until at last, you step back from the board to see your creation. You have finally made it, the is the weapon to replace all others, the devastation you could cause with this is undeniable. This is something the townsfolk of the world would speak in little more than a whisper; out of fear they might be next. Some might even call it enough to change the shape of civilization.","Desc2_input":"You take a few moments to look at the design, you spot a small issue with a single calculation on one of the angles. You run the numbers once again and you correct the angle. But one tweak to one angle, impacts another. This angle change impacts the tension, the tension change impacts the force available. This then continues on and on, until so much has changed, the design no longer works. The great weapon is little more than an irrational doodle on a chalkboard.","Desc3_input":"Once again, another night, wasted. All because of a few simple calculations. You awaken, and whilst you have a clear memory in your mind of the machine you created, you know it is impossible and not worth a second thought. Like many nights before, you were on the precipice only to be robbed at the final step. Maybe tomorrow night will be your night?","Desc4_input":"","Desc5_input":"","Desc6_input":"","Desc7_input":"","Desc8_input":""}
