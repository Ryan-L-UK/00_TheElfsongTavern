    <h1 id="crimson-stone">Crimson Stone</h1>
    <p>Rarity: Legendary Type: Wonderous Item</p>
    <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
    <p>
      The stone is large, around the size of a coconut, and is filled with a
      curious red liquid. The liquid inside is a deep crimson and doesnt flow
      like water. It seems to have a thickness to it. The stone walls are thick
      and a look at the stone suggests that it has been around for hundreds of
      years, and probably will continue to do so.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2 id="the-transition">The Transition</h2>
    <p>
      The possessor will start to transition to a vampire, all the while they
      are holding the stone. The desire to drink blood will come almost
      immediately, maybe not in the way they see. They will also start to get a
      small sensitivity to light. They will never be allergic to it, like a true
      vampire. But they will certainly start to be less than amused by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any bite they perform will not pass on the vampiric trait to others, but
      they will be able to claim the necrotic bonus trait.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bite will start to inflict necrotic damage the longer the possessor has
      the stone for, you can see information on the table below which relates to
      the amount of damage. For a base bite you can use the formula below:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bite (To Hit) = D20 + Strength Mod + Proficiency Bonus</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Bite (Piercing Damage) = 1D6 + Strength Mod.</strong></p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Days</th>
          <th>Bonus Necrotic Damage</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Day 1</td>
          <td>1x D4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Day 2</td>
          <td>2x D4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Day 3</td>
          <td>3x D4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Day 4</td>
          <td>3x D4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Day 5</td>
          <td>4x D4 (Transition)</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h2 id="blood-frenzy">Blood Frenzy</h2>
    <p>
      When a player has held the stone for 5 consecutive days without handing it
      to someone else, the transition takes effect and the vampiric nature
      becomes permanent. They are able to shapeshift into a tiny bat or a medium
      black mist at will. There are some draw backs and you will find yourself
      succumbing to more vampiric life style and will become subjected to the
      Blood Frenzy Attacks.
    </p>
    <aside>
      üßõüèª When a vampire looses control of itself because of its Blood Addiction
      weakness the vampire enters a state called blood frenzy. The blood frenzy
      ends when the vampire uses its bite attack to successfully inflect
      necrotic damage on a target, unless noted otherwise in its individual
      description. Whilst under the blood frenzy the vampire gains the
      following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The vampire shapeshifts back to its vampire form and cannot use its
          shapechanger feature until the frenzy ends.
        </li>
        <li>
          The vampire has advantage on melee weapon attack rolls, but attack
          rolls against it have advantage until the frenzy ends.
        </li>
        <li>The vampire cannot use any spells until the frenzy ends.</li>
        <li>
          The vampire becomes immune to the charmed and frightened conditions
          until the frenzy ends.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="vampiric-weaknesses">Vampiric Weaknesses</h2>
    <h3 id="sunlight">Sunlight</h3>
    <p>
      Whilst you will not need to cover or protect yourself from the sun for
      fear of radiant damage, you will find yourself with disadvantage on both
      attack rolls and ability checks.
    </p>
    <h3 id="forbidden">Forbidden</h3>
    <p>
      You will find it impossible to cross the threshold to a residence with an
      invitation from one of the occupants. You will need their express
      permission to cross the threshold and until you get that you will not be
      able to enter a house/residence. This does not apply to abandoned
      properties.
    </p>
    <h3 id="running-water">Running Water</h3>
    <p>
      Contact with running water will now come at a price. If you end your turn
      within a running water source you will take acid damage.
    </p>
    <h3 id="stake-to-the-heart">Stake To The Heart</h3>
    <p>
      Whilst it wont kill you, if someone were to discover your vampiric nature
      and decide to kill you, driving a stake through your heart would inflict
      double damage.
