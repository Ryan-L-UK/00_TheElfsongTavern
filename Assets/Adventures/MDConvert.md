# Crimson Stone

Rarity: Legendary
Type: Wonderous Item

## Description

The stone is large, around the size of a coconut, and is filled with a curious red liquid. The liquid inside is a deep crimson and doesnt flow like water. It seems to have a thickness to it. The stone walls are thick and a look at the stone suggests that it has been around for hundreds of years, and probably will continue to do so.

## The Transition

The possessor will start to transition to a vampire, all the while they are holding the stone. The desire to drink blood will come almost immediately, maybe not in the way they see. They will also start to get a small sensitivity to light. They will never be allergic to it, like a true vampire. But they will certainly start to be less than amused by it.

Any bite they perform will not pass on the vampiric trait to others, but they will be able to claim the necrotic bonus trait.

A bite will start to inflict necrotic damage the longer the possessor has the stone for, you can see information on the table below which relates to the amount of damage. For a base bite you can use the formula below:

******\*\*******Bite (To Hit) = D20 + Strength Mod + Proficiency Bonus******\*\*******

************\*\*************Bite (Piercing Damage) = 1D6 + Strength Mod.************\*\*************

| Days  | Bonus Necrotic Damage |
| ----- | --------------------- |
| Day 1 | 1x D4                 |
| Day 2 | 2x D4                 |
| Day 3 | 3x D4                 |
| Day 4 | 3x D4                 |
| Day 5 | 4x D4 (Transition)    |

## Blood Frenzy

When a player has held the stone for 5 consecutive days without handing it to someone else, the transition takes effect and the vampiric nature becomes permanent. They are able to shapeshift into a tiny bat or a medium black mist at will. There are some draw backs and you will find yourself succumbing to more vampiric life style and will become subjected to the Blood Frenzy Attacks.

<aside>
üßõüèª When a vampire looses control of itself because of its Blood Addiction weakness the vampire enters a state called blood frenzy. The blood frenzy ends when the vampire uses its bite attack to successfully inflect necrotic damage on a target, unless noted otherwise in its individual description. Whilst under the blood frenzy the vampire gains the following:

- The vampire shapeshifts back to its vampire form and cannot use its shapechanger feature until the frenzy ends.
- The vampire has advantage on melee weapon attack rolls, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the frenzy ends.
- The vampire cannot use any spells until the frenzy ends.
- The vampire becomes immune to the charmed and frightened conditions until the frenzy ends.

## Vampiric Weaknesses

### Sunlight

Whilst you will not need to cover or protect yourself from the sun for fear of radiant damage, you will find yourself with disadvantage on both attack rolls and ability checks.

### Forbidden

You will find it impossible to cross the threshold to a residence with an invitation from one of the occupants. You will need their express permission to cross the threshold and until you get that you will not be able to enter a house/residence. This does not apply to abandoned properties.

### Running Water

Contact with running water will now come at a price. If you end your turn within a running water source you will take acid damage.

### Stake To The Heart

Whilst it wont kill you, if someone were to discover your vampiric nature and decide to kill you, driving a stake through your heart would inflict double damage.
